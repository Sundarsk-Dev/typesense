Discover your typing personality through subconscious pattern analysis

Typesense goes beyond traditional typing speed tests by analyzing your subconscious typing patterns to reveal insights about your focus, stress levels, and confidence while typing. Using advanced heuristics and real-time keystroke analysis, it creates a unique "typing mood profile" for each session.

üîß Configuration
Database Setup
The SQLite database is automatically created on first run. If you encounter database errors, delete typing.db and restart the app.
Secret Key
For production deployment, change the secret key in app.py:
pythonapp.config['SECRET_KEY'] = 'your-secure-secret-key-here'

üßÆ Analysis Algorithms
Mood Detection Heuristics
python# Simplified algorithm overview
correction_rate = corrections / total_keystrokes
if correction_rate > 0.15: mood = "Stressed"
elif pauses > 10: mood = "Thoughtful"
elif wpm > 60 and corrections < 3: mood = "Confident"
# ... additional rules
Confidence Score Calculation

Base Score: 50 points
WPM Bonus: Up to +30 points (0.5 points per WPM)
Correction Penalty: -3 points per correction
Burst Bonus: Up to +20 points for fast typing sequences

Focus Score Calculation

Starting Score: 100 points
Correction Penalty: -5 points per correction
Pause Penalty: -2 points per long pause

üéÆ Usage Examples
Basic Typing Test

Visit the homepage
Click "30s Test" for a comprehensive analysis
Type naturally about any topic
Review your typing mood and suggestions

Viewing Analytics

Complete several typing tests
Click "View History" or visit /stats
Analyze your progress over time
Export data for external analysis

Interpreting Results

High corrections + low WPM: Try accuracy-focused exercises
Many pauses: You're a thoughtful typist - embrace it!
Fast bursts + low corrections: You're in the zone!

üõ†Ô∏è Customization
Adding New Moods
Extend the analyze_mood() function in app.py:
pythondef analyze_mood(wpm, corrections, pauses, bursts, total_keys):
    # Add your custom mood logic here
    if your_condition:
        return "Custom Mood üé®"
Modifying Scoring
Adjust weights in calculate_confidence() and calculate_focus() functions.
UI Customization

Modify colors in the <style> section of HTML templates
Adjust test durations in the frontend JavaScript
Customize suggestions in the get_suggestion() function

üêõ Troubleshooting
Database Errors
bash# Delete existing database and restart
rm typing.db
python app.py
